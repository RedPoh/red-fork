# Akidocs
Akidocs converts Markdown files to PDF. Part of a larger personal project with the goal of exploring documentation tooling. Currently very minimal.

⚠️ **Alpha software** ⚠️ - This is currently a learning project in early development. Expect frequent breaking changes, major missing features, and non-comprehensive documentation.

Currently functional on **Windows 11 via PowerShell,** all instructions for PowerShell if not otherwise specified. Other platforms remain untested.

## Current Features
Takes in a Markdown file, parses it, and outputs it as a PDF

- Headers (levels 1-6)
- Paragraphs
- Usable as a CLI tool (`aki`)
